IC1	Polygenic Architecture of Brain Structure and Lifestyle	IC1 emerges as a broadly polygenic factor without pronounced enrichment in any pre-curated gene sets, suggesting wide-ranging genetic influences on brain structure. This component also appears influenced by lifestyle factors, highlighting traits such as smoking and alcohol consumption. The most significant SNP of IC1 is located in a locus mapping to VCAN (Rahmani et al., 2006), which encodes an extracellular matrix component important for cell adhesion. CDC42, a Rho GTPase, is identified through locus mapping to genes within this component. Located on chromosome 1, CDC42 plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the actin cytoskeleton and is integral to neuronal morphogenesis, axonal guidance, and synapse formation (Etienne-Manneville & Hall, 2002). These functions are underpinned by its ability to regulate cell polarity and membrane dynamics in developing neurons. In the same locus on chromosome 1 we also found WNT4, identified by both locus gene mapping and via MAGMA gene analysis, which further supports a role in structural and organizational processes within the nervous system. WNT4, as part of the Wnt signaling pathway, mediates cell fate specification, cell-to-cell adhesion, and tissue patterning, all of which are vital to neurodevelopment and neural circuit maintenance (Khan & Verma, 2025). ACTR1B, located on chromosome 2, is identified as the most significant gene in the MAGMA analysis for this component, being also present in the locus mapping to gene. ACTR1B encodes subunits of dynactin, which is crucial for retrograde axonal transport and interacts with the actin cytoskeleton (Schroer, 2004). This further reinforces the component's link to cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal structure. The MRI brain measures that load most heavily on IC1 predominantly reflect diffusion metrics in white matter tracts, indicative of underlying differences in microstructural properties. These data, when integrated with the genetic findings, point to a possible collective influence of actin-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling and cell adhesion mechanisms on white matter organization. This component appears highly distributed across the genome, consistent with a polygenic architecture and non-specific mechanisms such as cell adhesion.
IC2	Myelination and Stress Response	IC2 is a much less widespread polygenic component, showing several clear peak loci. IC2 tentatively reflects myelin-associated pathways, stress-response mechanisms, and neurodegenerative processes. The Manhattan plot for this component shows a notable peak on chromosome 17, mapping to, CRHR1 (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1) on chromosome 17 linking IC2 to stress regulation (Perrelli et al., 2024). As a mediator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, CRHR1 modulates systemic stress responses. The same locus also involves MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau), which is related to neurodegeneration. This is also underscored by the FUMA trait analysis, showing that this locus has been previously associated with multiple neurological diseases such as Parkonsin's and Alzheimer's disease. The second most significant locus maps to HAPLN1 (hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1) on chromosome 5, which encodes a protein critical for extracellular matrix (ECM) stability. By maintaining ECM integrity, HAPLN1 supports oligodendrocyte function and myelin structure, aligning with the component's focus on myelination (Oohashi et al., 2015). Two other IC2 loci each map to myelin proteins; MOBP (myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein) and MBP (myelin basic protein) on chromosomes 3 and 18, respectively. MOBP stabilizes the myelin membrane, while MBP ensures myelin compaction, both vital for efficient axonal conduction (Aggarwal et al., 2013). MRI traits prominently loading on IC2 include total brain volume, total surface area, ventral diencephalon and striatum volumes, and multiple diffusion-based measures. While diffusion metrics reflect myelinated fibre pathways, other traits such as brain volume may capture broader structural or neurodevelopmental correlates. The ventral diencephalon is interesting as a top region for this locus, as it contains the hypothalamus, thus part of the HPA-axis. Finally, the GWAS catalog analyses resulted in hundreds of non-MRI traits previously associated with aforementioned loci, including neurodegeneration, psychiatric conditions, lifestyle factors, and blood biomarkers suggest IC2 integrates myelination, stress pathways, and environmental influences, shaping brain structure and integrity.
IC3	Cortical Development	IC3 is distinguished by a strong genetic signal evidenced by a huge peak on chromosome 5. This locus also emerged in IC1, but is much more prominent for IC3. The locus maps to two genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cell adhesion: VCAN (versican) and HAPLN1 (hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1). Both genes are also identified as the most strongly significant genes in both locus mapping to genes and MAGMA statistics. VCAN is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan critical for cellular adhesion, migration, and tissue remodeling, particularly during neural development. HAPLN1 contributes to ECM stability by cross-linking hyaluronan with proteoglycans, facilitating structural integrity in the developing brain. The associated gene set GOBP_NK_T_CELL_DIFFERENTIATION suggests that immune-modulatory processes, including the development and activation of NK and T cells, may intersect with brain development in this component. From a phenotypic standpoint, HP_APLASIA_HYPOPLASIA_OF_THE_NASAL_SEPTUM indicates developmental anomalies potentially sharing underlying pathways with brain development. MRI traits loading onto IC3 show contrasting effects across cortical volume and thickness versus subcortical volumes. Taken together, IC3 appears to represent core genetic underpinnings of cortical development, with strong evidence from a prominent peak on chromosome 5 driven by VCAN and HAPLN1.
IC4	Polygenic Regulation of MAPK Signaling and Neuronal Plasticity	IC4 is characterized by a relatively sparse genetic profile, indicating a highly distributed polygenic architecture. Yet its associated gene sets point toward phosphatase-mediated regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In particular, GOMF_MAP_KINASE_TYROSINE_SERINE_THREONINE_PHOSPHATASE_ACTIVITY and GOMF_PROTEIN_TYROSINE_THREONINE_PHOSPHATASE_ACTIVITY highlight the dephosphorylation of MAPK components, which is instrumental in modulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Shaul & Seger, 2007). Within the nervous system, MAPK activity underpins numerous processes central to neuronal plasticity, including learning, memory formation, and synaptic remodeling. The high-level involvement of phosphatases, such as dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), underscores the fine-tuned control of phosphorylation states necessary for precise neural function (Thomas & Huganir, 2004). From an MRI traits perspective, IC4 reflects volumetric, thickness, and diffusion-weighted imaging measures, though specific trait correlations are lacking. The absence of robust single-gene drivers or well-defined trait associations points to a widespread, polygenic influence on neural microstructure or functional connectivity. Consequently, IC4 is likely reflective of broad, systemic modulation of brain imaging phenotypes through fundamental cell signaling processes, implying that variations in phosphatase-driven MAPK regulation can have diffuse but meaningful effects on brain structure and function.
IC5	Inflammation and Neurotrophic Support	IC5 is notable for a prominent genetic locus on chromosome 6 overlapping the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, as clearly seen by a spike in the Manhattan plot and identified both via locus gene mapping and MAGMA gene analysis. This dominant signal from the HLA region strongly underscores the component's immunological underpinnings. The HLA complex encodes molecules pivotal for antigen presentation, facilitating immune surveillance and contributing to inflammatory processes that can influence neural tissue integrity. Beyond this immunological signature, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) on chromosome 11 emerges as a key contributor, though its signal is less prominent than the HLA region (Lima Giacobbo et al., 2019). BDNF is essential for neuronal growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity, and has been repeatedly implicated in learning and memory formation, particularly within medial temporal lobe structures. There are also indications that BDNF is protective against neuroinflammation (Porter & O'Connor, 2022). Additional genes contributing to IC5 include GMNC (geminin coiled-coil domain containing) on chromosome 3, a chromatin-binding factor that governs cell cycle progression and DNA replication, and SCFD2 (Sec1 family domain containing) on chromosome 4 (both of these genes are identified via locus gene mapping and MAGMA analysis), which participates in vesicular exocytosis and, consequently, neurotransmitter release and synaptic communication. The recurrent involvement of VCAN and HAPLN1 on chromosome 5, also observed in other components, further emphasizes the role of extracellular matrix organization in immune and trophic signals. MRI traits loading on IC5 are predominantly localized to the temporal lobesâ€”particularly diffusion and T1-weighted intensity measures. Given that the temporal lobe is rich in BDNF expression and highly susceptible to inflammatory processes, these converging signals may point to an integrated mechanism by which immune-related pathways and neurotrophic factors shape regional brain structure and function. Altogether, IC5 may thus encapsulate an interplay between immunogenetic factors (notably HLA loci), neurotrophic support (via BDNF), and extracellular matrix remodeling (via VCAN and HAPLN1), culminating in modulations of temporal lobe microstructure and function. The genetic architecture of IC5 is largely driven by the strong signal from the HLA region on chromosome 6.
IC6	Genetic Associations with Motor Pathways and Unclear Functional Interpretation	IC6 features a prominent genetic locus on chromosome 1, encompassing genes such as MR1 (major histocompatibility complex, class Iâ€“related) and STX6 (syntaxin 6). MR1 is involved in presenting microbial metabolites to immune cells, while STX6 plays a role in intracellular transport. Another locus on chromosome 6 includes CENPW (centromere protein W), important for chromosome segregation during cell division. These genes were identified through locus mapping (Kwon et al., 2007). MRI traits with high loadings on IC6 are primarily related to motor pathways, including the corticospinal tract, precentral gyrus, brainstem, and cerebellum. Interestingly, gene set enrichment analysis highlighted GOBP_HINDLIMB_MORPHOGENESIS as a significant association for IC6. However, the connection between this developmental gene set and the other genetic and neuroimaging findings for IC6 is not immediately apparent, and the functional meaning of this component remains uncertain. In conclusion, IC6 captures a combination of genetic associations and motor-related MRI traits. While we have identified suggestive genes and a gene set, a definitive interpretation of the underlying biological processes represented by IC6 is currently lacking.
IC7	Lifestyle and Ventricles	IC7 is characterized by a prominent genetic signal on chromosome 16, with FBXO31 (F-box protein 31) emerging as the most significant gene in both MAGMA and locus mapping analyses. FBXO31, may have a role in regulating the cell cycle as well as dendrite growth and neuronal migration (Vadhvani et al., 2013). A secondary locus on chromosome 7 implicates GNA12 (G protein subunit alpha 12), a regulator of GÎ±12/13 signaling pathways. GNA12 is essential for neuronal migration and synaptic organization during development. Its oncogenic roles are well-documented, but its intersection with neurodevelopmental pathways highlights potential pleiotropy in IC7's architecture (Moers et al., 2008). Trait associations for IC7 include ventricular volume, tau pathology, and many lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep, BMI, physical activity, smoking, diet). MRI measures with strongest loadings localize to the ventricles, thalamus, and fornix, regions sensitive to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and structural atrophy. Ventricular enlargement, a nonspecific biomarker of brain atrophy, correlates with aging and neurodegeneration. Lifestyle factors may indirectly influence these phenotypes through metabolic or inflammatory pathways, though genetic causality remains unproven.
IC8	Glutamatergic Signaling and Cortical Development	IC8 is driven by genes linked to zinc and calcium homeostasis, intersecting with glutamatergic synaptic function and cortical development. All genes are significant in both locus gene mapping and MAGMA analyses. SLC39A8 (solute carrier family 39 member 8, chromosome 4), a zinc transporter critical for systemic and neuronal zinc regulation, indirectly modulates synaptic plasticity and NMDA receptor activity (Lichten & Cousins, 2009). Variants in SLC39A8 are associated with neurodevelopmental risks (Poulter et al., 2013). MSRB3 (methionine sulfoxide reductase B3, chromosome 12), a zinc-dependent enzyme, mitigates oxidative damage to proteins, preserving mitochondrial integrity and neuronal viability. DOC2A (double C2-like domain-containing alpha, chromosome 16), a calcium sensor mostly expressed in brain tissues, regulates neurotransmitter release in glutamatergic synapses (Courtney et al., 2018). Notably, chromosome 16 contributes PPP4C (protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit) and YPEL3 (yippee-like 3), both located in the 16p11.2 region. PPP4C has an important role for cortical development, while YPEL3 modulates cellular senescence and growth arrest, processes tied to developmental stability. The 16p11.2 locus is a known hotspot for structural polymorphisms linked to autism and intellectual disability, aligning with IC8's neurodevelopmental focus (Toyo-oka et al., 2008). MRI traits loading onto IC8 predominantly highlight cortical thickness variations in glutamatergic-rich regions, such as the prefrontal and sensory cortices. Trait associations include lifestyle factors (diet, alcohol intake, smoking) and ventricular volume. While lifestyle behaviors may influence zinc/calcium availability, their genetic interplay with IC8 loci remains observational. Ventricular enlargement, a marker of brain atrophy, may reflect broader disruptions in ion homeostasis or developmental pathways. IC8's genetic architecture integrates zinc/calcium signaling (SLC39A8, DOC2A), redox balance (MSRB3), and developmental regulation (PPP4C, YPEL3), underscoring a convergence of synaptic, metabolic, and structural mechanisms in neurodevelopment and cortical integrity.
IC9	Genetic Control of Brain Asymmetry and Lateralized Cognitive Functions	IC9 is marked by a significant locus on chromosome 14 encompassing DAAM1 (dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1), which showed the most significant gene-level association in MAGMA analysis. DAAM1 is integral to Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, a core pathway governing cell fate, tissue patterning, and cytoskeletal dynamics, and drives actin cytoskeleton rearrangements required for cell polarity and axonal guidance (Habas et al., 2001). Also significant are ZIC1 and ZIC4 (zinc-finger proteins of the cerebellum 1 and 4) on chromosome 3. These genes regulate transcriptional programs for midline patterning and cerebellar development, and are implicated in structural asymmetries (Aruga, 2004). Trait associations for IC9 highlight mathematics and language aptitudes, as well as systemic leftâ€“right body asymmetries. MRI traits show differential loadings in occipital regions versus language-associated cortices, and higher loadings for right hemisphere thickness and intensity. In sum, IC9 captures a genetic architecture governing brain lateralization, strongly driven by DAAM1 and supported by ZIC1 and ZIC4, all genes playing roles in tissue patterning and axon guidance, and aligning with lateralized brain functions and structural features.
IC10	Lipid and Semaphorin Pathways in Myelination	IC10 reflects a polygenic profile, with loci converging on lipid metabolism and axon guidance pathways. Three major genes define its lipid-related dimension: GAL3ST1 (chromosome 22), ABHD12 (chromosome 20), and SLC27A3 (chromosome 1), showing significance in both locus gene mapping and MAGMA statistics. GAL3ST1 catalyzes sulfation of galactosylceramide, generating sulfatides critical for myelin stability and neuronal conductivity. ABHD12 hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS), a pro-inflammatory lipid implicated in synaptic pruning and microglial regulation; mutations here are linked to PHARC syndrome (polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia) (El-Fasakhany et al., 2001). SLC27A3 mediates long-chain fatty acid transport, influencing neuronal and glial metabolic homeostasis (Kazantzis & Stahl, 2012). The GOCC_SEMAPHORIN_RECEPTOR_COMPLEX gene-set underscores semaphorin signaling, a pathway guiding axonal pathfinding and neural migration. Semaphorins (e.g., SEMA3A) and receptors (e.g., neuropilins, plexins) regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, shaping neural circuitry in development and adulthood (Takahashi et al., 1999). Trait associations span blood lipid markers (LDL, HDL), insulin resistance, dietary patterns, and mental health indices, suggesting lipid-semaphorin crosstalk may influence metabolic and cognitive outcomes. MRI traits highlight grayâ€“white matter intensity contrast in the nucleus accumbens and basal ganglia, regions where myelin integrity depends on sulfatide synthesis (GAL3ST1). Diffusion metrics in the cerebellum and brainstem align with semaphorin-mediated axon guidance defects. In summary, IC10 captures genetic interplay between lipid metabolism (ABHD12, GAL3ST1, SLC27A3) and semaphorin signaling, potentially affecting myelination, neural connectivity, and systemic metabolism. While polygenic, lipid-related loci dominate its architecture.
IC11	Polygenic Basis of Risk-Taking Behavior and Associated Traits	IC11 represents a highly polygenic component, characterized by a broad spectrum of trait associations and a notable, though not singular, concentration of genetic signal on chromosome 8. Due to its polygenic nature, pinpointing specific causal genes is challenging, and the listed genes from MAGMA analysis should be considered as potential candidates within a much larger polygenic landscape. Despite the lack of clear single-gene drivers, the consistent association of five independent loci with risk-taking behavior is particularly interesting. This suggests that IC11, through its complex polygenic architecture, may influence fundamental biological processes that have downstream consequences on behavioral traits related to impulsivity, reward processing, and decision-making. Multiple loci are also associated with blood pressure and educational attainment. While the co-occurrence of such traits alongside risk-taking might appear disparate, it is plausible that shared, broadly acting biological mechanisms contribute to these diverse phenotypes. For example, systemic processes like stress response dysregulation or chronic low-grade inflammation could influence both metabolic health and neural circuits involved in risk assessment and impulsive actions. It is important to note that attributing specific roles to individual genes within this polygenic component is speculative at this stage. Genes like FDFT1, DEFB cluster, MSRA, and SOX7 on chromosome 8 are mentioned as examples of genes within the region, but their individual contributions to risk-taking or other IC11 traits remain to be determined and are likely to be small within the overall polygenic context. Similarly, the presence of developmental genes like ZIC1 and ZIC4 on chromosome 3 highlights the potential for developmental origins of these pleiotropic effects, but again, within a complex polygenic framework. In summary, IC11 is best characterized as a highly polygenic component associated with a wide array of traits, with a noteworthy association with risk-taking behaviors. This component likely reflects a complex and distributed genetic architecture impacting diverse biological systems, manifesting in variations in brain volumes and cortical thickness, and influencing both physiological and behavioral traits. While the chromosome 8 peak is observed, the polygenic nature of IC11 makes it difficult to attribute causality to specific genes. Further research is needed to disentangle the complex polygenic architecture of IC11 and to understand the broader biological mechanisms that link its diverse trait associations, with a particular focus on elucidating the polygenic underpinnings of its influence on risk-taking behavior. This interpretation remains tentative and emphasizes the need for caution in over-interpreting the role of individual candidate genes within this highly polygenic component.
IC12	Genetic Regulation of Circadian Rhythms and Sleep	IC12 is dominated by a huge genetic peak on chromosome 15, indicating a major genetic influence on this component from this region. Our automated gene mapping pipeline did not pinpoint specific genes within this locus. However, further manual investigation of the chromosome 15 peak reveals that it is located close to GPR176, a gene known to be a key regulator of the circadian clock. This suggests that GPR176, or potentially other genes in this locus, are likely major contributors to the chromosome 15 signal and to IC12 overall (Doi et al., 2016). In addition to this chromosome 15 signal found through manual investigation, our automated analyses identified associations with DDN (dendrin, chromosome 12) and VAX1 (ventral anterior homeobox 1, chromosome 10), both significant in locus gene mapping and MAGMA analyses. DDN is important for synaptic plasticity during sleep, and VAX1 is crucial for the development of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Hoffmann et al., 2021; Neuner-Jehle et al., 1996). MAGMA analysis also identified LINC02915 (chromosome 15), a long non-coding RNA located within the dominant chromosome 15 locus, though its precise role in circadian rhythms is not yet well-established. MRI traits loading on IC12 include total brain volume and cortical surface area, with a specific pattern in sensorimotor cortices. Trait associations include various sleep-related phenotypes like insomnia and sleep disturbance. In summary, IC12 reflects a strong genetic influence from the chromosome 15 locus (suggestively linked to GPR176 through manual investigation), alongside contributions from genes identified by our automated pipeline that are involved in synaptic plasticity and SCN development. This component captures a genetic architecture shaping both brain structure and sleep-wake regulation, with a major signal originating from the chromosome 15 locus and pointing towards circadian rhythm mechanisms.
IC13	Polygenic Convergence on Myelination, Cytoskeletal Organization, and Lipid Homeostasis	IC13 reflects a polygenic architecture with loci converging on pathways critical for myelination, cytoskeletal organization, and lipid homeostasis. Locus mapping identified genes such as GAL3ST1 (chromosome 22), DAAM1 (chromosome 14), MOBP (chromosome 3), and SEC14L4 (chromosome 22). GAL3ST1 is involved in sulfatide biosynthesis, essential for myelin stability. MOBP is a structural component of myelin. DAAM1 regulates the cytoskeleton. SEC14L4 is hypothesized to be involved in lipid transport (El-Fasakhany et al., 2001). Trait associations with IC13 include neuroticism, intelligence, and circulating sulfatide levels. MRI traits load most strongly on white matter structures. Despite these suggestive locus-based gene associations, IC13's polygenic nature and the lack of strong single gene drivers make a definitive interpretation challenging. The observed connections to myelination, cytoskeleton, and lipid pathways, and the trait associations, remain tentative and require further investigation to understand the underlying biological mechanisms.
IC14	Immune-Metabolic Interactions in Cortical Development	IC14 is characterized by a lack of strong individual gene or locus associations. Instead, its most informative features come from gene set enrichment analysis, which reveals significant associations with pathways related to immune regulation, lipid metabolism, and developmental signaling. While MAGMA analysis prioritizes genes like HLA-DRA, ARHGEF12, NUP210L, and TPM3, the signal for IC14 appears to be more broadly distributed across gene sets than concentrated in specific loci. The most significant gene sets for IC14 include GOBP_NOTCH_SIGNALING_PATHWAY, GOBP_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_FATTY_ACID, and GOBP_LEUKOTRIENE_D4_BIOSYNTHETIC_PROCESS. These suggest a convergence on Notch signaling, crucial for cortical layering, and metabolic-immune crosstalk involving fatty acid metabolism and inflammatory leukotrienes (Lasky & Wu, 2005; Nian & Hou, 2022). Consistent with these biological themes, MRI traits loading on IC14 show volumetric differences in frontal and temporal cortices. Interestingly, cortical thickness measures exhibit a clear left-right hemispheric split in their loadings on IC14, suggesting potential lateralized effects. In conclusion, IC14 is primarily a gene set driven component, highlighting the importance of immune-metabolic and developmental pathways, particularly Notch signaling, fatty acid metabolism, and leukotriene biosynthesis, in shaping cortical structure. The observed left-right asymmetry in cortical thickness adds another layer of complexity, suggesting potential lateralized roles for these pathways in cortical development. Further investigation should focus on the interplay of these biological processes in cortical organization.
IC15	Inflammation and Lipid Metabolism Influencing White Matter	IC15 highlights a genetic network influencing white matter organization via intersecting immune and lipid metabolic pathways. Among its notable features is a significant locus within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6, encompassing all of the HLA genes integral to immune response modulation. This HLA region signal is evident in both locus gene mapping and MAGMA statistics. Beyond this immunogenetic core, ENPP6 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 6) on chromosome 4, also significant in both analyses, plays a pivotal role in myelin homeostasis through sphingolipid metabolism, thereby supporting efficient signal conduction in the central nervous system (Morita et al., 2016). The adjacent involvement of DEFB135 and DEFB136 (defensin beta 135 and 136) on chromosome 8, emphasizes the significance of innate immune effectors in mitigating pathogens and maintaining neuroimmune balance (Xu & Lu, 2020). Additionally, LPAR1 (lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1) on chromosome 9, significant in both analyses, involved in lipid signaling, myelination and immune regulation. LPAR1, a G-proteinâ€“coupled receptor, modulates cell proliferation, migration, and inflammatory responses via lysophosphatidic acid. The link to FTH1 (ferritin heavy chain 1) on chromosome 11, also significant in both analyses, further integrates iron homeostasis with neural integrity and oxidative stress defense (Ward et al., 2014). In line with these molecular indicators, MRI traits reveal strong loadings on intracellular volume fraction from diffusion-weighted MRI, suggesting that these loci collectively affect white matter cellular composition, possibly reflecting alterations in oligodendrocyte density or myelin structure. Trait associationsâ€”including dietary preferences (e.g., fish and pork consumption), cholesterol metrics, white blood cell counts, and inflammatory markersâ€”underscore how variations in immune and metabolic pathways can shape both systemic health and white matter microstructure. Altogether, the genetic signal for IC15 is driven by a prominent locus in the HLA region on chromosome 6 and supported by contributions from other loci involved in lipid metabolism and immune function. IC15 captures a multifaceted genetic framework wherein immune response, lipid metabolism, and iron regulation converge to influence white matter integrity, offering insight into potential susceptibility factors for neuroinflammatory and demyelinating conditions.
IC16	Genetic Regulation of Cell Differentiation - Centriole Assembly Focus	IC16 is characterized by a very dominant genetic locus on chromosome 15, a signal shared with IC12, underscoring recurrent genetic factors in neurodevelopmental processes. This chromosome 15 locus includes LINC02915, a long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, which may play a regulatory role in neurodevelopment (Mercer et al., 2008). Gene-set analysis reveals a strong association with GOBP_DE_NOVO_CENTRIOLE_ASSEMBLY, implicating centriole and cilia function in neurogenesis and neural circuit maturation. Centrioles are microtubule-organizing centers essential for cell division and ciliogenesis, processes critical for neural progenitor proliferation and migration in the developing central nervous system (Breslow & Holland, 2019). MRI traits show heterogeneous loadings across regions involved in motor control, cognitive function, and metabolic regulation. Trait associations include progressive supranuclear palsy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and metabolic/immune indices. In summary, IC16 captures a genetic influence that is chiefly driven by the chromosome 15 locus and its involvement in de novo centriole assembly, underscoring a key biological pathway likely critical for neural development.
